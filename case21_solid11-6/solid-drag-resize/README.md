Simple, flexible library for creating draggable and resizable components in SolidJS.

Near feature parity to [react-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd) and [vue-draggable-resizable](https://github.com/mauricius/vue-draggable-resizable). If you don't care about resizing, other good dragging-only libraries for solid are: [@neodrag/solid](https://www.neodrag.dev/docs/solid), [solid-dnd](https://solid-dnd.com/), and [solid-dnd-directive](https://github.com/isaacHagoel/solid-dnd-directive).

## TODO List
* [x] Fix boundary observer
* [x] Rework enabled/dragEnabled/resizeEnabled
* [x] Fix touchscreen
* [x] Fix custom resize handles
* [ ] Event delegation instead of tons of listeners
* [ ] Tests
* [ ] Docs

## Quick start

Install it:

```bash
npm i solid-drag-resize
# or
yarn add solid-drag-resize
# or
pnpm add solid-drag-resize
```

Use it:

```tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web"
import { DragAndResize } from "solid-drag-resize"

render(() => <DragAndResize />, document.body);
```

## Props
Here are the props options, taken right from the code. Children will be passed through correctly, and any other props will be shallowly merged onto this component. For example, although this library will set the `style` attribute of its main element, you can add and override to it.

```typescript
export type Props = {
    /**
     * Defaults to true. The component cannot be dragged or resized when this
     * is false. The component's position and size can still be
     * programmatically controlled via the `position` and `state` properties.
     * Inputting an object with the keys `drag`, `resize`, separates control of
     * dragging and resizing.

     */
    state?: Partial<State>;

     * Resizing will be prevented below this size, though a smaller size
     * may be programmatically set by the `state` prop.
